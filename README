Zool
====

Gatekeeper for Raspberry Pi and other embedded devices

WARNING: Zool is currently in a reserch stage and most of its features are not
implemented yet.

Zool is a system targeted at single board devices and providing monitoring and
remote access solutions to a local network.

Zool can be used to:

- Turn on and off machines on the network
- Monitor for new devices on a network
- VPN into the network
- Take action on camera/microphone activity
- Send notifications to mobile devices

One of Zool's goal is to provide a stable and permantent connection to a remote
location, without having to configure the remote network (if you want to use
the VPN feature, you'l still have to open an UDP port). In order to achieve
this, Zool requires a server to connect to (Also refered to as the mothership).
The mothership can be any machine that is permanently available on the
internet, any cheap VPS will do, the important is being always connected, specs
such as RAM, CPU or disk space are irrelevant here.

Zool uses a combo of supervisor and autossh to keep the connection with the
mothership alive at all times, it just needs to be powered on to be available.
